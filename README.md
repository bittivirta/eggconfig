# Gamepanel Eggs Configs

This repository contains the configs for the eggs used by the gamepanel.fi.

The repository exists to make it easier to update the configs and to keep them in sync with the panel. The repository is not meant to be used directly by the users. The configs are automatically updated to the panel when the repository is updated. The repository is public to make it easier to contribute to the configs.

If you see any issues with the configs, please contact us at [bittivirta.fi](https://bittivirta.fi/). Pull requests are most likely not accepted.
